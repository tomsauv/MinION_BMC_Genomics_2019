# MinION flow cell 1D metadata (R9.0 and R9.4) 

This repository contains:

A tab delimited file of metadata gathered from published studies
```
MinION_metadata.txt
```

An R script to produce the figure below with packagae ggplot2
```
MinION_metaplot.r
```

The metadata reports (per flow cell):

1. Number of 1D reads (in millions)

2. Average 1D read length (in bp)

3. Flow cell yield (in Gbp).

Interested users may add/subsitute their data and run the script to place their flow cell output in context.
