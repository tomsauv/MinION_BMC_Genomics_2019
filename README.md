# MinION Flow cell 1D metadata R9.0 and R9.4 

This repository contains:
Tab delimited metadata gathered from published studies (see file "MinION_metadata.txt")
An R script to produce the figure below ("MinION_metaplot.r")

The metadata includes number of 1D reads produced (in millions) and corresponding average 1D read length (in bp) and flow cell yield (in Gbp).

Interested users may add/subsitute their data and run the script to place their flow cell output in context.
